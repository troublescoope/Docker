2. **Customize Dockerfile:** Customize the Dockerfile to meet your project's requirements. Modify package installations, add extra dependencies, or make other adjustments as necessary.

3. **Build Docker Image:** Build the Docker image using the following command:

   ```sh
   docker build -t my-megacpp-app .
   ```

4. **Run Container:** Launch a container based on the newly built image:

   ```sh
   docker run -it --rm my-megacpp-app
   ```

5. **Develop and Test:** Inside the container, you can use MegaSdkC++, Aria2, and qBittorrent for development, testing, and download management.

## Using Aria2 and qBittorrent

To utilize Aria2 and qBittorrent within your Docker environment:

1. **Access qBittorrent Web UI:** After running the container, qBittorrent's web UI is accessible at `http://localhost:8080` (username: `admin`, password: `adminadmin`).

2. **Use Aria2 for Downloads:** You can utilize Aria2 to initiate downloads by running commands like:

   ```sh
   aria2c "http://example.com/file.zip"
   ```

   This will initiate a download using Aria2.
